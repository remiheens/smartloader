# SmartLoader

SmartLoader is a library that allows you to easily manage your js and css on your site.

When you have lot of js & css to include dynamically, itâ€™s difficult and complex. With SmartLoader, you have some functions to enqueue code or links in controllers and you just have to output the queue in your footer.

If you know wordpress development, this library works like the wp_enqueue function. In your controller, you can enqueue some js and css link, and output this in footer.
